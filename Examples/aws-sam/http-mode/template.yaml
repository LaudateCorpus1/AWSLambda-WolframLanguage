Description: >
  Example AWS SAM app using the Wolfram Language Lambda runtime
  with an HTTP-mode function connected to an API Gateway API

Parameters:
  OnDemandLicenseEntitlementID:
    Type: String
    NoEcho: true
    Description: >
      The ID of a Wolfram on-demand license entitlement to use to
      activate the Wolfram Engine within your function container(s).

      # This tells API Gateway to represent HTTP request and response bodies
      # as Base64-encoded binary data instead of as plain text. This is necessary
      # in order for requests and responses containing binary data (e.g. images)
      # to work. If you disable this, then you should instruct the Wolfram
      # Language Lambda runtime to skip encoding responses to Base64. You can do
      # this by setting the WOLFRAM_LAMBDA_HTTP_USE_PLAIN_TEXT_RESPONSE
      # environment variable to 1 in the function configuration, or by setting
      # the $AWSLambdaUsePlainTextResponse Wolfram Language variable to True
      # in your handler file.
